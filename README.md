# CMPE255Assignment_1
a) Pick a kaggle data set which might be fairly noisy (Eg: https://analyticsindiamag.com/10-datasets-for-data-cleaning-practice-for-beginners/ (Links to an external site.) or more)  b) write a data cleaning and preprocessing  and visualization colab using any data set - you can find few from kaggle  etc.,.  (Eg: use for inspiration not copy paste   https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/DataScience/BangloreHomePrices/model/banglore_home_prices_final.ipynb (Links to an external site.) or   https://youtu.be/wPri78CFSEw?t=945  https://colab.research.google.com/gist/rafiqhasan/6f00aecf1feafd83ba9dfefef8907ee8/dl-e2e-taxi-dataset-tf2-keras.ipynb or use any other colabs i provided in data preparation slide deck) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdfbcdP75KI&amp;list=PLeo1K3hjS3ut2o1ay5Dqh-r1kq6ZU8W0M (Links to an external site.)   c) you can do model training with scikit learn as well but we will not check the accuracy/performance of the model. the main focus is whether you did the right data cleaning  Please try to use a number of techniques in there and do comprehensive cleaning and pre processing. write colab with great comments and description     please submit the colab and a read.me in github folder - provide the url of github folder (with full public access)     Try to combine number of techniques in leaderboard members of kaggle for data cleaning if possible.
